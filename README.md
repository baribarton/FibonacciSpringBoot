# FibonacciSpringBoot
Very simple web service that displays Fibonacci numbers

You can run this two ways:

Download this to an IDE (I ran it with IntelliJ) and run it. Otherwise, run this command:
java -jar <PATH>/FibonacciSpringBoot/target/FibonacciSpringBoot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Then, go to localhost:8080/{number} to view the program results
